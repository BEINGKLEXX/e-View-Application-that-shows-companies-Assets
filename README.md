Components

    Components are the parts that constitute an asset.
    Components are typically associated with an asset, but the customer may want to add components without an asset as a parent or with a location as a parent
    Components typically include vibration or energy sensors, and they have a operating or alert status
   

Assets/Sub-Assets

    Assets have a set of components
    Some assets are very large, like a conveyor belt and they may contain N sub-assets.
    Assets are typically associated with a location, but the customer may want to add assets without specifying a location as a parent.
    You can know that an item is a asset, if they have another assets or components as children.
   

Locations/Sub-Locations

    Locations represent the places where the assets are located. For very large locations, the customer may want to split them to keep their hierarchy more organized. Therefore, locations may contain N sub-locations.
